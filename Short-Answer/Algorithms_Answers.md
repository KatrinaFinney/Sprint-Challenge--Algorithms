#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Run time analysis for this one is O(n)
f(n) = (n*n*n) /a + n*n
f(n) = n

b) Run time is O(n^2)
There are two loops iterating over n


c) Run time is O(log n)
Recursive function where n is assigned once 

## Exercise II

This problem could be solved using a binary search.

  start at the middle floor

  drop the first egg
  if the egg breaks, 
  return current floor and higher floors as solution
  if the egg doesn't break, 
    go up a floor and 
    drop the next egg,
    continuing the loop until an egg breaks
